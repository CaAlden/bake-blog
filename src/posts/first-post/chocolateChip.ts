## Steps
**Preparation**: It is important for the butter to be kept at room tempurature (${units === Units.Imperial ? '75째F' : '25째C'})
so that the blending process is easier.

1. Preheat the **oven** to **${units === Units.Imperial ? '375째F' : '190째C'}**
2. Mix together the butter and sugar in a medium sized mixing bowl until the the mixture is smooth.
3. Add the Egg to the mixture and stir well to fully incorperate.
4. In a separate bowl, mix together the dry ingredients briefly.
5. Slowly mix in the dry ingredients with the wet until a dough forms. There should be no remaining flour.
6. Encorperate the Chocolate chips and walnuts.
7. Place golf ball sized dough spheres on a parchment paper lined cooking tray and bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes.
8. Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for 5-10 minutes.

Cookies should be eaten quickly but will keep for up to 10 days.
