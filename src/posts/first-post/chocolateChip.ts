## Preparation:

It is important for the **butter** to be kept at room tempurature (${units === Units.Imperial ? '75째F' : '25째C'}).
If the butter is too cold it will be difficult to uniformly/smoothly mix it with the **sugar**.

## Recipe

1. Preheat the **oven** to **${units === Units.Metric ? '190째C' : '375째F'}**.
2. Mix together the **butter**, **white sugar**, and **brown sugar** in a medium sized mixing bowl until the the mixture is smooth.
3. In a separate bowl, mix together the **flour** and **baking soda**.`;

${n}. Mix the dry ingredients from the separate bowl with the wet mixture. Add the **chocolate chips** and **walnuts** into the mixture.
${n + 2}. Scoop approximately **24** golf ball sized spheres of dough onto a **parchment paper** lined baking tray and bake in the **oven** for **10-12** minutes.
${n + 3}. Allow to cool on a **wire rack** before eating!

4. Whisk in the **egg** and **vanilla extract**.

## Notes

These cripsy cookies taste best freshout of the oven, but will keep for up to **10** days.

${opening(units)}
4. Separate one **egg yolk** and add it plus one **egg** to the mixture. Whisk to incorperate then add the **vanilla extract**
${remainingSteps(units, 5)}

## Notes

These cookies should be slightly chewier than their whole egg counterparts and will keep for up to **10** days. They will
remain fully chewy for at least a **week**.
`

const getChewySteps = (units: Units) => `
${opening(units)}
${remainingSteps(units, 6)}

## Notes

These cookies should keep for up to **10** days and will remain almost brownie-like for at least a **week**, although
we found that these were best straight out of the oven.
