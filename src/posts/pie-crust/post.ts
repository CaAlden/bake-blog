**Quick Note**: For this bake we relied heavily on [this Recipe from Inspired Taste](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/4746/basic-pastry-dough/), to the point where it would feel slightly disingenuous to post our own version of the recipe. If you would like to recreate this bake, follow that recipe but create your own flour (or purchase flour) with the corresponding protein percentages listed in the table below.

With that out of the way, hello again! I've been letting these posts go unwritten, and as I find myself with some time to work on them, I feel obligated to clear out my backlog and document some of the work I have already done. This post is all about _Pie Crusts_ which I baked several months ago with my friend Sara. Our goal was to create a spread of different pastry doughs with different finishes. We hoped each dough might be useful in different situations.

The two questions we wanted to answer with this baking experiment were:

1. How does the percentage of protein in the flour one uses affect the texture and taste of pastry dough?
2. Is it worth the extra effort to add a wash to your pie crust / dough, and if so, what sort of wash is best?

While researching for this bake, I discovered that there was some disagreement about the best percentages of protein in the flour used for making pastry dough. Some sources listed protein percentages between 5% and 8% as ideal while others suggested something closer to 10% was best. There were also several different types of washes and toppings given to enhance each crust. We identified egg and butter washes as the two most common, and salt or sugar as the most common additive toppings.

## Methodology

After examining several recipes, we identified the aforementioned [Inspired Taste one](https://www.inspiredtaste.net/4746/basic-pastry-dough/) as a solid representative of the average pastry dough. We calculated the ingredient percentages in that recipe and used them as a baseline. Then we tweaked those percentages slightly to get numbers that would allow for easier step sizes as we mixed together our custom flours. For this bake we made a total of 6 doughs with protein percentages varying between our 8% flour (薄力粉 -- Hakurikiko -- "Light Flour" used similarly to All-Purpose Flour) and our 12% flour (強力粉 -- Kyourikiko -- "Heavy Flour" used when baking breads).

The following table shows the exact amount of each type of flour that was used and the corresponding percentages of protein in each dough we tested.

| Test Number | Light Flour (g) | Heavy Flour (g) | Protein (%) |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 1           | 70              | 0               | 8           |
| 2           | 56              | 14              | 8.8         |
| 3           | 42              | 28              | 9.6         |
| 4           | 28              | 42              | 10.4        |
| 5           | 14              | 56              | 11.2        |
| 6           | 0               | 70              | 12          |


As for the egg and butter washes, we did not do anything special. The egg wash was simply a beaten egg and the butter wash, melted butter. Each disk that received a wash had its top side fully coated. Next, we used a plastic stencil to evenly coat 1/3 of the disk in sugar and 1/3 of the disk in salt, leaving the final third as a control containing just the wash.

For each flour we created three disks to act as sample pie crusts. One disk was set aside as a control and the others were given an additional wash (egg or butter). Each disk was then adorned with toppings (salt or sugar). In the end we were able to taste test effectively 54 unique pie crusts.

## Results

![Our spreadsheet for calculating our flour percentages and normalizing recipes with the flours we used to concoct our custom flours on the right.](${desktopXFlours})

The difference between each type of crust was fairly subtle with the main takeaway being that protein percentages in the middle 9%-11% were slightly better than the lower or higher ends of the spectrum. This coincides with some of the research that said 10% might be the best number. Broadly speaking, the lower the percentage protein doughs resulted in weaker, flakier crust. The higher the percentage doughs resulted in a stronger crust. By using the ~10% flour, the resulting crust is flaky and light while still being structurally sound. Depending on what type of pastry you intend to make, you might consider using a higher percentage flour for added structural integrity.

Some of the recipes we gathered while researching for this bake suggest using protein percentages between 5% and 9% which was below the scale that we tested. The lowest percentage of protein we could find while shopping for this bake was 8%, although in our opinion, the flours between 9% and 11% performed best, which goes against the theory that a lower protein percentage flour is better. If we assume the qualities we observed across the various doughs behave linearly with respect to the protein percentage, we would expected the 8% protein flour to do the best overall since it would be closest to the 5% value listed on some sites. That was not the case with our bakes, so I feel confident putting forward 10% as the best value.

Let's now turn our attention to the washes and toppings. Deciding between salty and sweat comes down to the types of flavors you are looking for in your bake. Both types of toppings added something to the overall experience, but it is hard to make broad statements about which is better without knowing the rest of the picture.

The washes, however, have a massive affect on the optics and flavor of the pie crust. The crusts that were given the egg wash were shiny and took on a beautiful color. The butter wash was obviously delicious and took on a lighter brown sheen. Comparing either wash to the control batches makes it clear that using some sort of wash is an easy way to boost the appeal of your pastries!
